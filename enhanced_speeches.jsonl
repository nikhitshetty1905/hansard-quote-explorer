One of the greatest difficulties with which we have to contend is the addition from time to time of the lowest class of labour workers who will not join a trade union and who come over here ignorant, poverty-stricken, and very likely not even knowing the language.. That is the class of immigrants that breaks down the rate of wages.. It is these aliens who are the despair of tin trades unions and the Government officials.", "frame": "RACIALISED", "hansard_url": "https://api.parliament.uk/historic-hansard/commons/1905/may/02/aliens-bill", "extraction_quality": 6.0}
